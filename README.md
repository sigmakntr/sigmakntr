## 👋 Hi there! I'm Kentaro Fujimoto.
I'm a web engineer working at a tech company, but coding isn't just my job—it's my passion! 🚀  
In my free time, I love building web apps, developing mobile apps, and writing about tech on my blog.  
I'm also a cycling enthusiast and enjoy traveling to new places.

Most of my repositories are private, but feel free to check out my projects! 😃
