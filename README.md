## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Kentaro Fujimoto.
I'm a web engineer working at a tech company, but coding isn't just my jobâ€”it's my passion! ðŸš€
In my free time, I love building web apps, developing mobile apps, and writing about tech on my blog.
I'm also a cycling enthusiast and enjoy traveling to new places.

Most of my repositories are private, but feel free to check out my projects! ðŸ˜ƒ
